# No Numbers for Figma
Get rid of default numbers in layer names. Why keep Rectangle 164 if it's just a Rectangle?

## **How to use**

**Just run it** from the Quick Actions or Plugin menu. The plugin will remove default numbers from every layer on the page.

Alternatively, you can select some layers. The plugin will rename them and their children (if any).

## **How it works**

It turns default layer names like _Rectangle 420_ or _Frame 69_ to simple _Rectangle_ or _Frame_. It will beautify layers mess and help to keep your files clean and pretty.

The plugin won't affect any other layer names. It works with frames, groups, slices and any vector objects as well.

## **Problem? Idea? Kind words?**

I accept feature suggestions and ideas to improve the plugin. No need to mess with locked layers? Rename on all pages at once? Useful exceptions? If you have any ideas or issues, let me know in the comments.
